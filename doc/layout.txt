Layout of documents
===================


Generally there are three types of system specification documents:

- requirements definition
- requirements specification
- software specification

The requirements definition states what services the software is
expected to provide and the constraints under which it must operate,
whereas the requirements specification sets out the system services in
detail.  The software specification details the overall design of the
sotware.

For this project, the multi-gee software library, the requirements
definition is as follows:

    Provide a image capture library with low latency that provides
    synchronised images to the consumer.

Refer to the api.txt file for the requirements specification, and to
design.txt for the software specification.
